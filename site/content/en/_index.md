# `KWOK` (`K`ubernetes `W`ith`O`ut `K`ubelet)

<img align="right" width="180px" src="/favicon.svg">

[KWOK] is a toolkit that enables setting up a cluster of thousands of Nodes in seconds.
Under the scene, all Nodes are simulated to behave like real ones, so the overall approach employs
a pretty low resource footprint that you can easily play around on your laptop.

## What is KWOK?

KWOK stands for Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet. So far, it provides two tools:

- `kwok` is the cornerstone of this project, responsible for simulating the lifecycle of fake nodes, pods, and other Kubernetes API resources.
- `kwokctl` is a CLI tool designed to streamline the creation and management of clusters, with nodes simulated by `kwok`.

## Getting Started

The animation below shows a test process to work with the latest version of `kwok`/`kwokctl`.

Welcome to [get started]({{< relref "/docs/user/getting-started" >}}) with the installation, basic usage, custom configuration,
and [contribution to KWOK]({{< relref "/docs/contributing/getting-started" >}}).

## `kwokctl` Runtime and OS Support

Runtime indicates which medium `kwokctl` will use to start the cluster

|         | binary | docker | kind | nerdctl | podman |
