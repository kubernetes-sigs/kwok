                              Error describes any problems reconciling the Spec.ConfigSource to the Active config.
                              Errors may occur, for example, attempting to checkpoint Spec.ConfigSource to the local Assigned
                              record, attempting to checkpoint the payload associated with Spec.ConfigSource, attempting
                              to load or validate the Assigned config, etc.
                              Errors may occur at different points while syncing config. Earlier errors (e.g. download or
                              checkpointing errors) will not result in a rollback to LastKnownGood, and may resolve across
                              Kubelet retries. Later errors (e.g. loading or validating a checkpointed config) will result in
                              a rollback to LastKnownGood. In the latter case, it is usually possible to resolve the error
                              by fixing the config assigned in Spec.ConfigSource.
                              You can find additional information for debugging by searching the error message in the Kubelet log.
                              Error is a human-readable description of the error state; machines can check whether or not Error
                              is empty, but should not rely on the stability of the Error text across Kubelet versions.

                              LastKnownGood reports the checkpointed config the node will fall back to
                              when it encounters an error attempting to use the Assigned config.
                              The Assigned config becomes the LastKnownGood config when the node determines
                              that the Assigned config is stable and correct.
                              This is currently implemented as a 10-minute soak period starting when the local
                              record of Assigned config is updated. If the Assigned config is Active at the end
                              of this period, it becomes the LastKnownGood. Note that if Spec.ConfigSource is
                              reset to nil (use local defaults), the LastKnownGood is also immediately reset to nil,
                              because the local default config is always assumed good.
                              You should not make assumptions about the node's method of determining config stability
                              and correctness, as this may change or become configurable in the future.
