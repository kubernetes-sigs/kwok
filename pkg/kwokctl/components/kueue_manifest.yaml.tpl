                      or Cohort when competing for unused resources in the

                      above nominal quotas for each resource, divided by the
                      weight.  Admission prioritizes scheduling workloads from

                      preempting workloads from the ClusterQueues and Cohorts
                      with the highest share.  A zero weight implies infinite

                  within a Cohort.

                  Please note that nominalQuota defined at the Cohort level
                  represents additional resources on top of those defined by
                  ClusterQueues within the Cohort. The Cohort's nominalQuota
                  may be thought of as a shared pool for the ClusterQueues
                  within it. Additionally, this quota may also be lent out to
                  parent Cohort(s), subject to LendingLimit.

                  BorrowingLimit limits how much members of this Cohort
                  subtree can borrow from the parent subtree.

                  LendingLimit limits how much members of this Cohort subtree
                  can lend to the parent subtree.

                  Borrowing and Lending limits must only be set when the
                  Cohort has a parent.  Otherwise, the Cohort create/update
                  will be rejected by the webhook.

                      weight gives a comparative advantage to this ClusterQueue
                      or Cohort when competing for unused resources in the

                      above nominal quotas for each resource, divided by the
                      weight.  Admission prioritizes scheduling workloads from

                  nodeLabels are labels that associate the ResourceFlavor with Nodes that
                  have the same labels.
                  When a Workload is admitted, its podsets can only get assigned
                  ResourceFlavors whose nodeLabels match the nodeSelector and nodeAffinity
                  fields.
                  Once a ResourceFlavor is assigned to a podSet, the ResourceFlavor's
                  nodeLabels should be injected into the pods of the Workload by the
                  controller that integrates with the Workload object.

                  nodeLabels can be up to 8 elements.

                  nodeTaints are taints that the nodes associated with this ResourceFlavor
                  have.
                  Workloads' podsets must have tolerations for these nodeTaints in order to
                  get assigned this ResourceFlavor during admission.
                  When this ResourceFlavor has also set the matching tolerations (in .spec.tolerations),
                  then the nodeTaints are not considered during admission.
                  Only the 'NoSchedule' and 'NoExecute' taint effects are evaluated,
                  while 'PreferNoSchedule' is ignored.

                                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                      RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                      This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                      the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                      Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                      have the following effect:
                                      this init container will be continually restarted on
                                      exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                      containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                      will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                      is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                      container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                      for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                      container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                      init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                      completed.

                                  user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or

                                  removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the

                                          preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                          container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                          PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                          container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                          period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                          Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon probe failure.
                                          The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                          a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                                          Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                          If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                          value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                          Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                          the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                                          This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.

                                Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                                init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                                to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                                unique among all containers.
                                Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                                The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                                by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                                that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                                in a similar fashion.
                                Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                          preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                          container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                          PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                          container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                          period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                      RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.

                                      have the following effect:
                                      this init container will be continually restarted on
                                      exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                      containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                      will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                      is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init

                                          The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                          If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this

                                            If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                    seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                    It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                    Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                    "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                    This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                    "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                    This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                    It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                    Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                    whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                    CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                    "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                    If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                    If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                    and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                    This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                    All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                      MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                                      spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                      incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                                      to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                                      for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                      MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                      Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
                                      be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                                      MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                      When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                      between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                      The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                      or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                      In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                      - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                      scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                      violate MaxSkew(1).
                                      - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                      When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                      to topologies that satisfy it.
                                      It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                      MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                      When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                      Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                      And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                      this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                      As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                      scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                      If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                      Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                      When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                      The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                      In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                      because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                      it will violate MaxSkew.

                                      to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                      MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler

                                      ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                      The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                      and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                      Use this if:
                                      a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                      b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                         tracking are needed,
                                      c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                      d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                         a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                         information on the connection between this volume type
                                         and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                      Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                      APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                      of an individual pod.

                                      Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                      be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                      more information.

                                      A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                      persistent volumes at the same time.

                                          Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                          The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                          owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                          pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                          `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                          entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                          is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                          An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                          will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                          volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                          the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                          meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                          owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                          this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                          manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                  dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                  volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                  core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                  When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                  the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                                  provisioner.
                                                  This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                  if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                  compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                  both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                  value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                  When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                  dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                    specified.
                                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                    in any namespaces.
                                                  (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                      image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                      The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                      - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                      - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                      - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                      The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                      A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                      The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                      The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                      The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                      Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                      The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                                Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate
                                                chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.

                                                Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a
                                                PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the
                                                request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
                                                certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
                                                certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
                                                source in its spec.

                                                Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
                                                by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
                                                timestamp.

                                                Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
                                                field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
                                                certificateChainPath fields.

                                                The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
                                                entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
                                                entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
                                                signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

                                                Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
                                                can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
                                                your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
                                                with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
                                                certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
                                                will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
                                                consistent.

                                                The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
                                                issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
                                                use the certificates it issues.

                                                certificateChainPath:
                                                  description: |-

                                                    Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath
                                                    and certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key
                                                    and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
                                                    files mid-rotation.
                                                  type: string
                                                credentialBundlePath:
                                                  description: |-
                                                    Write the credential bundle at this path in the projected volume.

                                                    The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks.
                                                    The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private
                                                    key.

                                                    The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued
                                                    certificate chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).

                                                    Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single
                                                    atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you
                                                    project them to separate files, your application code will need to
                                                    additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.

                                                    and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the

                                                    Valid values are "RSA3072", "RSA4096", "ECDSAP256", "ECDSAP384",
                                                    "ECDSAP521", and "ED25519".

                                                    maxExpirationSeconds is the maximum lifetime permitted for the
                                                    certificate.

                                                    Kubelet copies this value verbatim into the PodCertificateRequests it
                                                    generates for this projection.

                                                    If omitted, kube-apiserver will set it to 86400(24 hours). kube-apiserver
                                                    will reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable
                                                    value is 7862400 (91 days).

                                                    The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any
                                                    lifetime *shorter* than MaxExpirationSeconds, but no shorter than 3600
                                                    seconds (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver.
                                                    `kubernetes.io` signers will never issue certificates with a lifetime
                                                    longer than 24 hours.

                            The assignment specifies the number of Pods to be scheduled per topology
                            domain and specifies the node selectors for each topology domain, in the
                            following way: the node selector keys are specified by the levels field
                            (same for all domains), and the corresponding node selector value is
                            specified by the domains.values subfield. If the TopologySpec.Levels field contains
                            "kubernetes.io/hostname" label, topologyAssignment will contain data only for
                            this label, and omit higher levels in the topology

                            Example:

                            topologyAssignment:
                              levels:
                              - cloud.provider.com/topology-block
                              - cloud.provider.com/topology-rack
                              domains:
                              - values: [block-1, rack-1]
                                count: 4
                              - values: [block-1, rack-2]
                                count: 2

                            Here:
                            - 4 Pods are to be scheduled on nodes matching the node selector:
                              cloud.provider.com/topology-block: block-1
                              cloud.provider.com/topology-rack: rack-1
                            - 2 Pods are to be scheduled on nodes matching the node selector:
                              cloud.provider.com/topology-block: block-1
                              cloud.provider.com/topology-rack: rack-2

                            Example:
                            Below there is an equivalent of the above example assuming, Topology
                            object defines kubernetes.io/hostname as the lowest level in topology.
                            Hence we omit higher level of topologies, since the hostname label
                            is sufficient to explicitly identify a proper node.

                                          PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an

                                          preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                          container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                          PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                          container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                          period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                          The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                          a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.

                                          If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                          value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                          Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via

                                          This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.

                                      RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                      This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                      the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                      Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                      have the following effect:
                                      this init container will be continually restarted on
                                      exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                      containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                      will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                      is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                      container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                      for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                      container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                      init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                      completed.

                                  user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
                                  scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is

                                          PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an

                                          preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                          container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                          PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                          container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                          period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                          The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                          a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.

                                          If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this

                                            If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                            If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made

                                Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                                init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                                to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                                unique among all containers.
                                Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                                The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                                by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                                that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                                in a similar fashion.
                                Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                          container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                          PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                          container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                          period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                      RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                      This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                      the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                      Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                      have the following effect:
                                      this init container will be continually restarted on
                                      exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                      containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                      will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                      is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                      container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                      for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                      container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                      init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                      completed.

                                    seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                    It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                    Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                    "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                    This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                    "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                    This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                    It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                    Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                    whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                    CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                    "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                    If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                    If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                    and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                    This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                    All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                      Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                      tolerate all taints of a particular category.
                                      Lt and Gt perform numeric comparisons (requires feature gate TaintTolerationComparisonOperators).

                                      between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                      The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                      or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                      In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                      |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                      - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                      scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                      violate MaxSkew(1).
                                      - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.

                                      Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                      And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                      this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                      As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                      scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                      If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                      Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                      When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                      The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                      In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                      because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                      it will violate MaxSkew.

                                      WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                                      the spread constraint.
                                      - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                      - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                        but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                        skew.
                                      A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                      if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                      "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                      If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                      to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                      MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                      won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                      The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                      and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                      Use this if:
                                      a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                      b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                         tracking are needed,
                                      c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                      d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                         a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                         information on the connection between this volume type
                                         and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                      Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                      APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                      of an individual pod.

                                      Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                      be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                      more information.

                                      A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                      persistent volumes at the same time.
                                    properties:
                                      volumeClaimTemplate:
                                        description: |-
                                          Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                          The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                          owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                          pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                          `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                          entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                          is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                          An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                          will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                          volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                          the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                          meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                          owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                          this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                          manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                          This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
                                          to the PVC after it has been created.

                                                  dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                  volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non

                                                  This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                  if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards

                                                  both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                  value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                  When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                  dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                    specified.
                                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                    in any namespaces.
                                                  (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                      image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                      The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                      - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                      - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                      - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                      The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                      A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                      The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                      The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                      The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                      Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                      The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                          Policy for pulling OCI objects. Possible values are:
                                          Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                          Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                          IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                          Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                                Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate
                                                chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.

                                                Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a
                                                PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the
                                                request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
                                                certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
                                                certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
                                                source in its spec.

                                                Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
                                                by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
                                                timestamp.

                                                Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
                                                field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
                                                certificateChainPath fields.

                                                The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
                                                entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
                                                entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
                                                signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

                                                Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
                                                can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
                                                your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
                                                with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
                                                certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
                                                will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
                                                consistent.

                                                The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
                                                issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
                                                use the certificates it issues.
                                              properties:
                                                certificateChainPath:

                                                    Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath
                                                    and certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key
                                                    and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
                                                    files mid-rotation.
                                                  type: string

                                                    Write the credential bundle at this path in the projected volume.

                                                    The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks.
                                                    The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private
                                                    key.

                                                    The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued
                                                    certificate chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).

                                                    Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single
                                                    atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you
                                                    project them to separate files, your application code will need to
                                                    additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.

                                                    maxExpirationSeconds is the maximum lifetime permitted for the
                                                    certificate.

                                                    Kubelet copies this value verbatim into the PodCertificateRequests it
                                                    generates for this projection.

                                                    If omitted, kube-apiserver will set it to 86400(24 hours). kube-apiserver
                                                    will reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable
                                                    value is 7862400 (91 days).

                                                    The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any
                                                    lifetime *shorter* than MaxExpirationSeconds, but no shorter than 3600
                                                    seconds (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver.
                                                    `kubernetes.io` signers will never issue certificates with a lifetime
                                                    longer than 24 hours.

                                                    metadata in any way.

                                                    These values are copied verbatim into the `spec.unverifiedUserAnnotations` field of
                                                    the PodCertificateRequest objects that Kubelet creates.

                                                    Entries are subject to the same validation as object metadata annotations,

                                                    Signers should document the keys and values they support. Signers should

                            and specifies the node selectors for each topology domain,
                            in the\nfollowing way:\n* `levels` specifies the node
                            selector keys (same for all domains).\n  - If the TopologySpec.Levels
                            field contains \"kubernetes.io/hostname\" label,\n    topologyAssignment
                            will contain data only for this label,\n    and omit higher
                            levels in the topology.\n* `slices` specifies the node
                            selector values and pod counts for all domains\n  (which
                            may be partitioned into separate slices).\n  - The node
                            selector values are arranged first by topology level,
                            only then by domain.\n    (This allows \"optimizing\"
                            similar values; see below).\n* The format of `slices`
                            supports the following variations\n  (aimed to optimize
                            the total bytesize for very large number of domains; see
                            examples below):\n  - When all node selector values (at
                            a given topology level, in a given slice)\n    share a
                            common prefix and/or suffix, these may be stored\n    in
                            dedicated `prefix`/`suffix` fields.\n    If so, the array
                            of `roots` will only store the remaining parts of these
                            strings.\n  - When all node selector values (at a given
                            topology level, in a given slice)\n    are identical,
                            this may be represented by `universal` value.\n  - When
                            all pod counts (in a given slice) are identical,\n    this
                            may be represented by `universal` pod count.\n\nExample

                            are to be scheduled on nodes matching the node selector:\n

                            1 - but using extracted prefix and universalValue.\n\ntopologyAssignment:\n

                            3:\n\nNow suppose that:\n- the Topology object defines
                            kubernetes.io/hostname as the lowest level\n  (and hence,
                            in the topologyAssignment, we omit all other levels\n
                            \ since the hostname label suffices to explicitly identify
                            a proper node),\n- we assign 1 Pod per each node,\n- the
                            node naming scheme is `block-{blockId}-rack-{rackId}-node-{nodeId}`.\nThen,
                            using the \"extraction of commons\", the assignment from
                            Examples 1-2 would look as follows:\n\ntopologyAssignment:\n
                            \ levels:\n  - kubernetes.io/hostname\n  slices:\n  -
                            domainCount: 6\n    valuesPerLevel:\n    - individual:\n
                            \       prefix: block-1-rack-\n\t\t   roots: [1-node-1,
                            1-node-2, 1-node-3, 1-node-4, 2-node-1, 2-node-2]\n    podCounts:\n
                            \     universal: 1\n\nExample 4:\n\nBy using multiple
                            slices, we can afford even longer common prefixes.\nThe
                            assignment from Example 3 can be alternatively represented
                            as follows:\n\ntopologyAssignment:\n  levels:\n  - kubernetes.io/hostname\n

                  was assigned, providing placement context for new scaled-up workloads. This supports
                  affinity or propagation policies across workload slices.
